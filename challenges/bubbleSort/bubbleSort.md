## bubbleSort

**Difficulty**: Easy

## Prompt 

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through an array of numbers, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

Write a function called `bubbleSort` that given an array of integers returns an array with the integers sorted in ascending order. You are **NOT** allowed to use the JavaScript `sort()` method.

## Examples 

```js
bubbleSort([1,7,3,6,1]) //=> [1,1,3,6,7]
bubbleSort([-1,9,10,2,0]) //=> [-2,-1,0,2,9,10]
```
